# Todo List Application Overview
# Introduction
The Todo List App is a project designed to facilitate task management by allowing users to create, edit, and mark tasks as complete within a user-friendly interface.

# Features
Upon launching the application, users are greeted with a simple interface comprising a text input field and two buttons.

Adding Items: Users can add items to the list by entering text into the input field and either pressing the "Enter" key or clicking the "Add Item" button.

Item Management: Each item in the list is accompanied by three icons on the right side:

The first icon is a cross symbol, allowing users to delete the corresponding item from the list.
The second icon represents an edit option, enabling users to modify the content of the item.
The third icon, in the form of a checkmark, enables users to mark the item as completed.
Filtering: Users can toggle between viewing completed and incomplete items using the "Filter" button located above the list. Upon activation, this button separates the list into completed and incomplete tasks, providing users with a filtered view based on their selection.

# Usage
Adding Items: Enter the task description into the text input field and either press "Enter" or click "Add Item" to add it to the list.
Managing Items: Utilize the icons associated with each item to delete, edit, or mark tasks as complete.
Filtering: Click the "Filter" button to toggle between viewing completed and incomplete tasks, providing a refined view of the task list based on user preference.











# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
